  2.Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
 
  3.You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image
  
  
  
  
  # Color
  >Color is the aspect of things that is caused by differing qualities of light being reflected or emitted by them. 
  >To see color, you have to have light. When light shines on an object some colors bounce off the object and others are absorbed by it.
  > Our eyes only see the colors that are bounced off or reflected.
  > and which make our page more meaningfull .

  > There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
XX Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
XX It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
XX CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
XX CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA .
